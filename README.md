# World_Weather_Analysis

##Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an app to assist in planning travel based on weather. The user can input their ideal minimum and maximum temperatures and the app will return a list of cities in the world that meet their criteria, along with hotels and weather in those cities. The results are shown on a Google map using Google's Maps API. A second function is to select specific cities and plan a travel route between those cities.
